## Overview
### The challenge
Reproduce exactly the card given in the example.

### Links
- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](bomberqlf.github.io/Blog-Card/)

## My process
- I started building my project with HTML as always. 
I already had an idea of how to structure my code for a card so it wasn't very difficult and the fact that, right after finishing my HMTL structure I styled my page using different CSS properties I were familiar with thanks to the QR Code Challenge.

### Built with
- HTML
- CSS 
- (Flex --> flex-direction)
- Mobile First Workflow

### What I learned
I reinforced my knowledge of Flex and how to use it faster. I don't need to think to much anymore.
Concerning what I really learned here, I didn't know how to add an image before a text but I actually found out very quickly and on my own so I'm proud of it.
